# Signale und Systeme
This repository contains interactive material for the course "Signale und Systeme" (signals and systems) read at the university of applied sciences ([HTW](https://www.htw-berlin.de/)) Berlin by [Markus NÃ¶lle](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=9586). 

It is a collection of individual Jupyter notebooks which are supposed to deepen and foster the understanding of selected topics presented during the lectures.

Ther are basically two different ways of using these notebooks
* either local execution (requires a functioning installation of [Jupyter-lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)) or
* execution in the cloud [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/htw-ikt-noelle/SignaleUndSysteme.git/master?urlpath=lab) using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
